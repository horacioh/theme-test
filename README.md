# Gatsby @jxnblk/gatsby-theme-mdx-blog theme example

- Gatsby project using the [`@jxnblk/gatsby-theme-mdx-blog`](https://github.com/jxnblk/gatsby-theme-mdx-blog) theme.
- created with the [starter-hello-world](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world)
- It's overriding the `styles.js` only to show the issue

The reason I create this repo is to show a theme issue not applying the styles into the website.
